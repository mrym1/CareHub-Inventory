# CareHub-Inventory
CareHub is a donation inventory with a dynamic front-end. It's my 4th semester project of Database course in which, I use Bootstrap for front-end, php for connecting to database where database is created using Mysql.
Its a complete web project with Front-End as well as Back-End.
